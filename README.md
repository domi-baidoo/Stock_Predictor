Predicting the stock prices of Apple on the S&amp;P 500 using Python and Machine Learning

# Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict stock prices, specifically for Apple (AAPL). It utilizes historical stock data from Yahoo Finance and employs a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Historical stock data for AAPL is downloaded using the `yfinance` library.
2. **Data Preparation:** The data is cleaned and prepared for machine learning by removing unnecessary columns, creating a target variable, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training:** A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the historical data to predict whether the stock price will go up or down the next day.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision score.
5. **Backtesting:** A backtesting system is implemented to simulate the model's performance over time.
6. **Model Improvement:** Additional predictors, such as rolling averages and trend indicators, are added to improve the model's accuracy.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following:

* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
* Libraries: `yfinance`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file.
3. Run the code cells in order.

## Results

The model achieves a precision score of 51%. This indicates the model's ability to roughly predict when the stock price will go up. Further improvements can be made by exploring different models, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering.
